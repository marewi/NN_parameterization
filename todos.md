### TODOs
- [x] dynamic start
    - [x] solving substraction problem
- [x] train policy for each group of points (e.g. for each logo)
    - [?] find optimal sequence of pictures for training model (maybe new epsilon for each picture)
- [x] change measurement to accumulated reward & reward per episode
    - [X] tostring func for parameters
- [X] concept to show learning results (strategy)
    - [X] show values
    - [x] show direction strategy
        - [x] log all old qtable_direction files
- [?] evaluation method
    - [ ] RL for evaluation?
- [ ] reduce prints (e.g. goal created)
- [ ] train model with neural network
- [ ] testing other algorithms instead of q-learning
- [ ] any parallelism possible?
